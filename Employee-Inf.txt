Employee-Inf-2016 dataset contains 29 features with the class. these 29 features all about employees information and behaviour that companies depend on for deciding about the employees future working

these 29 features contained personal information, educational information, working background information, besides of the class that contain the decision (recommend) if the employee deserve the recommendation for promotion or not.

I have collected this dataset in the communication and construction companies in Kurdistan\Iraq. It will be useful with the classification model techniques in data mining.
